Researchers have discovered a new species of dinosaur in Argentina. The dinosaur, named Bajadasaurus pronuspinax, lived approximately 140 million years ago during the Cretaceous period. It was a herbivore with a long neck and spiky back, similar to the more well-known Stegosaurus. The discovery sheds light on the diversity of dinosaurs in South America during the Cretaceous period.
